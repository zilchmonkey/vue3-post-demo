# Vue 3 Post Demo

This demo showcases the use of Vue 3 with the Composition API. It also highlights the integration of Radix-Vue, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and GraphQL.

This project utilizes [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), although npm should work seamlessly as well.

## Project setup

### Install dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### Run dev

```
pnpm run dev
```

### Compile and minify for production

```
pnpm run build
```

### Run production build

```
pnpm run preview
```

Due to CORS restrictions the GraphQL query will only work on "http://localhost".
